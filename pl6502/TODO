- Reintroduce incSP()?

Reset sequence (find an opcode for it?):
- Load PCl with 0, Load PCh with 0
- Copy program to RAM:
    - For each instruction:
        - Place instructions on the bus
        - Enable PCl and PCh
        - Set RAM
        - Increment PC
- Load SP with 253 (or with 0 and decrement twice?)
- Load status with 0
- Set ALU_c to 0
- Load PCl with RAM[0xFFFD], Load PCh with RAM[0xFFFC] // reset vector
