- Reintroduce incSP()?


Reset sequence (find an opcode for it?):
- Clear PC(l/h) (special signal)
- Write RST instruction to RAM[0]
    - Write RST to data bus
    - Toggle RAM_s

    - RST instruction
        - Load SP with 253 (or with 0 and decrement twice?)
        - Load status with 0
        - Set ALU_c to 0
        - Set PCh, PCl to 0

- Write LOAD instruction to RAM[0]
   - Write RST to data bus
    - Toggle RAM_s

    - LOAD instrucion
        - Set PCh, PCl to 0
        - Place instruction on the bus
        - Enable PCl and PCh
        - Set RAM
        - Increment PC
        - 64times

- Load PCl with RAM[0xFFFD], Load PCh with RAM[0xFFFC] // reset vector
